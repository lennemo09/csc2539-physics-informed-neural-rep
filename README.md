## Week 1: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

### Introduction to PDEs, Nonlinear PDEs, and Finite Difference Numerical Solvers
In this notebook, we introduce partial differential equations (PDEs), discuss the difference between linear and nonlinear PDEs, and learn about finite difference methods for numerically solving PDEs. We implement and visualize solutions for two examples:
- The Heat Equation (a linear PDE).
- Burgers' Equation (a canonical nonlinear PDE), a fundamental nonlinear partial differential equation used in fluid mechanics and nonlinear wave propagation.

You can find the notebook [here](/wk1-pinn/pde.ipynb).

### PINN for Burger's Equation
This notebook focuses on the Burger's equation introduced in the previous notebook. This time, we uses PINN to generate the solution, which is visualized and compared against the finite difference solver. 

You can find the notebook [here](/wk1-pinn/pinn.ipynb).

### PINN for Damped Spring Simulation
In this notebook, we simulate a damped spring system using a traditional numerical method and visualize its time evolution. We then use a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to reconstruct the damped spring simulation.
